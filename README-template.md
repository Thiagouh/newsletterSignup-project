## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned several key concepts related to form validation and DOM manipulation using JavaScript. I got hands-on experience with event handling, manipulating element styles dynamically, and working with regular expressions for email validation. Additionally, I practiced integrating JavaScript with HTML and CSS to enhance the user experience, especially when dealing with success and error messages. This project helped solidify my understanding of how to validate form inputs and create dynamic, user-friendly interfaces.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to continue refining my JavaScript skills, particularly in more complex form validation scenarios. I aim to deepen my understanding of error handling and provide users with even more helpful and accessible feedback. Additionally, I want to explore integrating backend services for form submissions and learn how to handle data asynchronously. As more complex projects come, Iâ€™ll focus on building more dynamic, interactive, and responsive features, with an emphasis on usability and performance optimization.

### Useful resources

- [Reset CSS](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) - I used this to eliminate default browser styles and ensure consistency across different browsers. It helped create a clean slate for styling my project.
