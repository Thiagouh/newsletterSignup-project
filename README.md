## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript for form validation and DOM manipulation

### What I Learned

This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of form validation and DOM manipulation using JavaScript. Key takeaways include:

- Handling events and preventing default form submission behavior.
- Dynamically manipulating element styles to provide user feedback.
- Using regular expressions to validate email addresses.
- Integrating JavaScript with HTML and CSS to create a seamless user experience.

Additionally, I gained experience in creating accessible and user-friendly error and success messages, which helped me solidify my skills in building interactive interfaces.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Further refine my JavaScript skills, especially in handling more complex form validation scenarios.
- Explore backend integration for form submissions and learn how to handle data asynchronously.
- Focus on building more dynamic, interactive, and responsive features while prioritizing usability and performance optimization.

### Useful Resources

- [Reset CSS](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) - This resource helped me eliminate default browser styles and ensure consistency across different browsers.
- [MDN Web Docs - Regular Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) - This guide was invaluable for understanding and implementing email validation using regular expressions.
